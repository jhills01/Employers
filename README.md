# WELCOME EMPLOYERS!

Thank you for your time and consideration. I've attempted to structure this repo in a way that's easy to navigate the hiearchy and understand files. Please see **Description** below for further information on folder structure, how to interpret files, etc.

If you have any suggestions and/or comments, please feel free to email me at [jhills@vols.utk.edu](mailto:jhills@vols.utk.edu) or post an issue here. 

## Description

1. Most files contain only code that I have personally written, though there are some exceptions where my code is interlaced with code provided beforehand. Some noteable examples of "interlaced" files (NOTE: the vast majority of these examples occur in lower level courses and labs):
    - makefiles
    - C/C++ headers
    
2. Many CPP files provide summary information at the top explaining the purpose of the lab.   
 
3. Some project folders only contain my code which relies heavily on many other files provided to me, but were removed for clarity. Some exceptions include: 
    - "UnderGraduate/CS_302/finalProj" contains work from other teams members to help understand the program as a whole. However, my code can easily be found in "Tom" directory.
