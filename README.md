# WELCOME EMPLOYERS!

Thank you for your time and consideration. I've attempted to structure this repo in a way that's easy to navigate and understand files. Please see **Description** below for further information on folder structure, how to interpret files, etc.

If you have any suggestions and/or comments, please feel free to email me at [jhills@vols.utk.edu](mailto:jhills@vols.utk.edu) or post an issue. 

## Description

1. Most projects only contain files with code I've personally written, though there are some exceptions:
    - Some files are a mixture of my code and provided/template code. 
    - Some projects include files that were not written by me, but were used as libraries/references when completing the project. I thought it necessary to include them 
      for a full understanding.
 
2. Some projects in "UTK\Graduate\6_2022_spring\CS566_SoftwareSecurity_Ruoti" were solving security challenges online, so it's a mixture of
    - code written by myself
    - use of a software tool downloaded from a git repository 

3. For project/assignment description:
    - Many CPP files provide summary information at the top explaining the purpose of the lab.
    - Some projects have a pdf or other document explaining the assignment
    - Some projects have a README.md which I created if documentation was lacking.
   
4. My legal name is John Hills, but I normally go by Tom. In some projects you'll see "Tom Hills" in files, "tom" as folder names, etc, so I thought this was worth mentioning to avoid confusion.
