# WELCOME EMPLOYERS!

Thank you for your time and consideration. I've attempted to structure this repo in a way that's easy to navigate the hiearchy and understand files. Please see **Description** below for further information on folder structure, how to interpret files, etc.

If you have any suggestions and/or comments, please feel free to email me at [jhills@vols.utk.edu](mailto:jhills@vols.utk.edu) or post an issue here. 

## Description

1. Most files contain only code that I have personally written, though there are some exceptions where my code is interlaced with code provided beforehand. Some noteable examples of "interlaced" files (NOTE: the vast majority of these examples occur in lower level courses and labs):
    - makefiles
    - C/C++ headers

2. For project/assignment description:
    - Many CPP files provide summary information at the top explaining the purpose of the lab.
    - Some projects have a pdf or other document explaining assignment
    - Some projects have a README.md which I created if documentation was lacking.
