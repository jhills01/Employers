# WELCOME EMPLOYERS!

Thank you for your time and consideration. I've attempted to structure this repo in a way that's easy to navigate the hiearchy and understand files. Please see **Description** below for further information on folder structure, how to interpret files, etc.

If you have any suggestions and/or comments, please feel free to email me at [jhills@vols.utk.edu](mailto:jhills@vols.utk.edu) or post an issue here. 

## Description

1. Most files contain only code that I have personally written, though there are some exceptions where my code is interlaced with boilerplate code provided to me beforehand. Some noteable exceptions:
- Some *makefiles* are partially written by myself, while ones in later classes were completely written by me.
