# NOTE

Unfortunately, access to the MySQL database is no longer available so you won't be able to log in. Please see the screenshot to get an idea of what the website looked like. Also, the website was built in stages which you can see as **wp1**, **wp2**, etc.

Also, I couldn't find a description of the website, but please feel free to ask me question about the screenshot. In short, there was a persistent navigation section on the left, and a header section where an icon could be clicked for a drop down of options. The main section of the page displayed different php pages depending on user selection in navigation. The user could then fill out the fields and save the data to the MySQL database so it could be retrieved when logging back in.
