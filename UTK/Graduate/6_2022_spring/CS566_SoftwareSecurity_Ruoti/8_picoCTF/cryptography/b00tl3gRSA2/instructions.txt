Instructions:
1) You don't have to create "c.bin" file to pass with "--uncipher" flag. Just pass the unalterd "c" number. 
2) Also, when I created public key with "--createpub" flag, I got some output crap at the beginning of my "key.pub" file. Once I deleted it just leaving key info, everything worked.
