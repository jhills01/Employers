My executable is ./caseyChallenge8/test
to compile make sure you compile Map.cpp, PerlinNoise.cpp, and test.cpp individually with g++ -c -std=c++11
then link them together with g++ -o test test.o Map.o Perlinnoise.o
It generates a map with perlin noise that is 25x25, then resizes it to 15x15


Personal Rubric:

20 points: Make a rough version of the header file for the map
5 points: Define functions for getting and setting the time of day
5 points: Define functions for getting and setting the weather
10 points: create a rough version of terrain generation for the map


Time Logs:
03/25/2019
-Worked on writing functions in lab for 2hrs and out of lab for 1hr
	2:30pm to 4:30pm	2hrs
	7:00pm to 8:00pm	1hr
03/27/2019
-Worked on understanding perlin noise
	2:00am to 4:00am	2hrs
03/28/2019
-Worked on implementing perlin noise for terrain generation
	1:30pm to 4:00pm	2.5hrs
Total: 7.5hrs

I spent a little longer than I hoped to on the terrain generation part of the code, and I still have some balancing to do to make it look better, but overall so far I have a lot done for the project and this challenge went really well.
I completed everything in the rubric I made for myself for this challenge
