Report:
This challenge ended up being much more of an undertaking than I expected. I think this is mostly
due to the fact that I had to write a miniature version of our project in order to
practice combining our project into one working program. Goal 4 will have to be moved
to a "next step" because trying to properly handle movements with error checking will
take a fair bit of work. Overall, I think things will not be as bad moving ahead
given I wont have to write an entire program just to test my part of the project,which
is the "tying it all together" part of the project.

Note: This git is the git for our project, mine is under the file alexChallenge8

Future Goals:
1. Switch to Casey and Shivam's libraries.
2. Get unit movement and attacking working
3. Error Checking
4. Pass information from Casey and Shivam's libraries to Tom's graphics library.
5. Input victory conditions and bug test.
